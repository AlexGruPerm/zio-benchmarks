# zio-benchmarks

This project contains benchmarking suites for ZIO and other functional effect libraries.

The goal is to gain independent and precise insights into situations, where performance for functional effects tuning becomes non trivial.

Different algorightm, tricks and methods will help to develop a strong intuition when and how to use `ZIO` and other functional effects properly with the correct setup/tuning to gain the best application performance.
